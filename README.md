# Calliope
## Generating logo images with generative adversarial networks.

The idea of Calliope is to research one very difficult problem forneural   networks   â€“   creating   images   requiring   a   great   amount   ofcreativity,   such   as   logo   images.   By   using   generative   adversarialnetworks and clustering we are trying to achieve diversity of the resultsand grouping them into categories based on common features. We willtry to clarify and address the main challenges in creating effectivealgorithms for solving this problem and to determine the applicabilityof the contemporary machine learning techniques to a harder challengerequiring creativity and originality.
